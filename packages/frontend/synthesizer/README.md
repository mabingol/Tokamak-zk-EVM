# Tokamak-zk-EVM/synthesizer

## Overview
You can convert your Ethereum transactions into zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) even if you don't know zkp.

Synthesizer is a compiler that takes an Ethereum transaction as input and returns a wire map (in the form of a permutation map). Combined with the library subcircuits in [qap-compiler package](../qap-compiler), this wire map forms a zkp circuit specialized for the transaction. The transaction specific-circuit will be used as preprocessed input for [Tokamak zk-SNARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/507).

## Features
- Preliminary work for zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- Seamless integration with Ethereum's EVM
- Efficient witness calculation for zk-proofs
- TypeScript/JavaScript friendly API for blockchain developers

## Installation

Make sure you are currently in the "synthesizer" folder. To obtain the latest version, simply require the project using `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

This package provides the core Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implementation which is capable of executing EVM-compatible bytecode. The package has been extracted from the [@ethereumjs/vm](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/vm) package along the VM `v6` release.

## Usage
1. Prepare input files
    - Ethereum transaction ID (obtainable from [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io))
    - R1CSs of the library subcircuits in Circom's WASM format ([example](./src/tokamak/resources/subcircuitLibrary), obtainable from [qap-compiler package](../qap-compiler/outputs/wasm))
    - List of the library subcircuits ([example](./src/tokamak/resources/subcircuitInfo.ts), obtainable from [qap-compiler package](../qap-compiler/outputs))
    - List of the wires of the library subcircuits ([example](./src/tokamak/resources/globalWireList.ts), obtainable from [qap-compiler package](../qap-compiler/outputs))

2. INTERFACE GIF ANIMATION WILL BE ADDED HERE

3. Check your outputs ([example](./examples/tokamak/outputs))
